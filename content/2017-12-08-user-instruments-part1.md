***Profile***
We believe that a talented person can be talented in many ways, so each profile will have several portfolios – actor, dancer, origami master, or whatever. Each of the portfolios will have sufficient presentation materials like compcard, intro videos, or else. Thus a booker can easily choose certain portfolio from a talent, which is required for the certain event. 

***Search***
Search will be available both for bookers and talents in terms that it will be possible to look for jobs as well as for freelancers. We aim to make the platform intuitively simple so we will listen carefully to the suggestions of our community and at the same time utilize accepted industry standards. 

***Calendar***
For freelancers as well as for bookers it is essential to have perfect time management tool and MDL has a nice idea of how to make it! All the calendars will be linked into one database, so that bookers will be aware of talents schedule; and talents will be aware of upcoming events. The calendar will be also linked to blockchain so that all the events will be traceable. 

***Compcard creator***
Presentation is everything in this business, since the final client usually have time only to drop a glance on media materials.  We will make it easier for talents to make as well as to keep updated a nice professional compcard via our compcard creator, which will be available for everyone for free. 

***Application downloader***
It takes an effort for bookers to gather presentation materials and send them further to the final client. And for the final client it takes an effort to choose from different formats of presentations the most suitable talent and in the end of the day the materials appear to be fake ones! No more with MDL! First of all, we will make it easier to submit materials for client’s review by automatically combining them into a pdf file with all the relevant information and our reputation score will leave no place for cheating.
