It is said that some events have less probability to happen and some more. It looks like the event that took place on the 8th of October had pretty good chances to appear. All the puzzle pieces were collected in one place. It was a tiny step of initiation towards a great venture that is going to affect our society and even much more the lives of its direct stakeholders who were three…

Three friends from former Russian capital of Saint-Petersburg living in Shanghai and working in different industries – IT, international trade, and TVC production. The only thing that they had in common besides their nationality is a sparkling spirit of undertaking. And that was enough to begin…

But cut the pathetic shit!

It was pretty straightforward – the idea to join blockchain tsunami that is going to flood every economy sector in the nearest future was well-weighted and we have determined ourselves to be the first in the market we know, which is foreign model/artists segment of event and production industries. We have agreed that the combination of IT and blockchain expertise, market understanding and experience, legal and tax know-how gives us sound competitive advantage and excellent opportunity to shake the market disruptively.

Few words about us:

For each one of us this project is an important step forward within our careers and we all feel enthusiastic and prepared for the long-term sailing, for the storms and the calms that are going to happen on our way.

And we have started. Started to discuss, plan, learn, execute and have fun together.

MDL was the name.

And it has begun.
